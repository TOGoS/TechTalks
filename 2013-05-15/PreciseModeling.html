<title>Be Precise and Don't Repeat Yourself: How to Talk to Computers</title>

<p>I submit that:</p>

<p>By writing programs in terms of what to do rather than how to do
them, your programs will be less buggy, easier to maintain, probably
more efficient, and if not more efficient, easier to optimize.</p>

<p>Of course at some level you will need to tell the computer how to
do things, but by designing your APIs in terms of 'what' and
encapsulating the 'how' within function and object implementations,
your overall program structure will better represent the goal of the
program.</p>



<h2>Contrived Controller Class</h2>

<p>Server code for a simple web site that says "Hello, &lt;name&gt;"
when you go to /hello, "Goodbye, &lt;name&gt;" for any other URL.</p>

<p>A typical controller class for a PHP MVC framework might look
something like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    class SomethingController {
      var $request;
      var $response;
      var $whatToSay = "Goodbye";
      var $name = '';
      
      function initHello() {
        $this-&gt;whatToSay = "Hello";
      }
      
      function handleRequest() {
        $this-&gt;name = $this-&gt;request-&gt;getParameterValue('name');
        if( $this-&gt;request-&gt;pathInfo == '/hello' ) {
          $this-&gt;initHello();
        }
        $this-&gt;response-&gt;print($this-&gt;whatToSay . ', ' . $this-&gt;name);
      }
    }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>There are some problems with the way this class is written:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not obvious how to (for example) provide alternate response codes</li>
<li>To understand what the code is doing, you need to make assumptions
  about how it's called and track side-effects in your head<ul>
  <li>e.g. what are request and response, and when do they get
    initialized? (This code implies that the framework is doing
    this 'for you' at some point.)</li>
  <li>At what point in the code are the various instance variables
    set to the value you want?</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The controller object holds state for a single request/response,
  so cannot be re-used while that request is being handled.  That it
  won't be is yet another assumption about the environment.</li>

<li>Chunks of code could be left out and the program would still be
  syntactically correct but wrong.</li>

</ul>

<p>Here's a better solution:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    class SomethingRequestHandler {
      function handleRequest( Request $request ) {
        return new Response( 200,
          ($request-&gt;pathInfo == '/hello' ? "Hello" : "Goodbye") .
          ', ' .
          $request-&gt;getParameterValue('name') );
      }
    }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This is a more direct mapping of our requirements to code, so it's more
understandable.  It's also better code for other reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since the controller is stateless and the $request, there's no room for
  the handleRequest method to be called incorrectly.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of simple language features (function parameters and
  return values, in this case) cuts down on boilerplate code, which
  means other programmers can read and understand the code with less
  effort.</li>
<li>By defining the request handler as a function, we are more clearly
  modeling our solution.  After all, the response is ny definition
  <i>a function of</i> the request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even better, use a language with static typing and a decent
compiler:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    class SomethingRequestHandler {
      Response handleRequest( Request request ) {
        return new Response( 200,
          (request.pathInfo == "/hello" ? "Hello" : "Goodbye") + ", " +
          request.getParameterValue("name") );
      }
    }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Static typing serves as documentation for both the compiler and for
other programmers.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's obvious what request and response must be - no need to poke around
  in calling code or even read the documentation to understand how
  the function is used.</li>
<li>It allows the compiler to catch type mismatch problems that might cause
  subtle bugs in less strict languages.</li>
<li>It allows the compiler to make optimizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>A 'decent compiler' can point out obvious problems with your code before you
even run it.  Which means your programs are much more likely to work the
first time you run them and much less likely to have uncaught bugs.
When working on TOPS (a Java project) I did a major refactoring that would
have taken weeks and probably left subtle bugs all over if the code I
was working on had been written in a language without compile-time checks
(such as PHP).</li>

<p>Note: Java isn't perfect.  For one thing, I wish parameters could
be marked as not allowed to be null (there are various annotations for
this but not a standard way built into the language).  Rust is a
promising-looking language that's designed to help you write
safe/correct code while giving useful high-level constructs like
anonymous functions.</li>



<h3>Tips for good class design</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write unit tests.  Aside from the obvious benefits of having unit
  tests, designing classes to be unit-testable often forces you to
  understand your problem domain better and results in a more
  straightforward design.</li>
<li>Don't use instance variables when function parameters would
  suffice.  See <a
  href="http://www.nuke24.net/docs/2012/InstanceVariableMisuse.html">http://www.nuke24.net/docs/2012/InstanceVariableMisuse.html</a></li>
</ul>



<h2>Git</h2>

<p>Git is a good version control system because it explicitly models the
relationship between versions your project.</p>

<p>Git is a directed graph, where nodes are snapshots of your project
and edges point to parent commits.  This core model says nothing about
servers or authentication mechanisms and because of this decoupling it
a much more robust system than, say, subversion.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can move and duplicate repositories willy-nilly without worrying
  too much about synchronization or making people update their remotes
  repository references all at once.</li>
<li>Branches are free.  You can work on your own without
  pulling or pushing changes for a few days, and if someone else does
  work from the same start point, you've each made an anonymous branch.
  If only one person does this at a time and pushes back to the central
  repository when they're done, the history stays nice and linear.
  This nice stuff happens _automatically_ due to the data model.</li>
<li>This model also allows merging to be done automatically.
  Since git explicitly tracks parent commits, it can walk the
  commit history to find a the first common ancestor commit and
  only apply changes after that point.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason Git is successful is because it separates the data model
from how the data is managed, which makes the model simpler, which
makes it easier for people to deal with and makes it easier to build
tools that interact with it (e.g. GitHub).</p>

<p>Separating the data model from how the data is managed is something
that our projects can benefit from, too.  And to some extent we
already do this when we start a project by designing the database
first.  Relational databases happen to be pretty good at modelling the
kind of data that our projects work with.  If your project involves
the concept of a user, a product, a shopping cart, and a
hospitalization diagnosis, chances are there will be tables in the
database with those same names, and their relation to their
corresponding real-world object or abstract concept will be very
obvious.</p>

<p>Which makes me wonder: Why aren't the objects in our PHP/JavaScript
code as obvious and easily understandable as our database schemas?</p>

<p>I think they can be when programs are written in such a way that
the structures in the program (functions, data structures, APIs) map
directly to the concepts in the problem your program is solving.  But
traditional imperative languages (like C, PHP, and Java) don't
encourage this style of programming, and programmers spend so much of
their alloted brain power working around limitations of the language
that they don't have enough left to design a good high-level
architecture</p>

<p>In my experience, sticking to immutable data structures, modelling
functions as functions, and test-driven development help a lot.  But
those techniques are for a different talk.  So are character
encodings, though understanding character encodings also ties pretty
directly into the theme of being precise in order to build more
flexible and reliable software.</p>

<p>Anyway, the most important step to take in structuring programs
well is to <em>fully understand the problem you're trying to
solve</em> before you go and write a bunch of code (or download a
library that supposedly solves problems similar to yours).  When
you're working with expressive enough languages (e.g. SQL when used
for relatively simple queries) the process of writing the code can
help you understand the problem.  But when working with imperative
languages, especially ones that lack nice facilities for refactoring
(like static typing and compile-time assertions) you generally need to
put more thought into your architecture up front.</p>



<h2>SchemaSchema</h2>

<p>SchemaSchema is a language for declaring your data model and a Java
library that interprets it.  I use it to generate code for First30.
Here's some example schema:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    resource class 'provider type' : scope @ constant {
        provider type code : string : key(primary)
        name : string
        is community resource type : boolean
    }
    
    resource class 'provider' : scope @ org-tree {
        ID : entity ID : key(primary)
        defining organization ID : entity ID
        provider type code : string
        name : string : nullable
        name prefix : string : nullable
        first name : string : nullable
        last name : string : nullable
        name suffix : string : nullable
        description : string
        e-mail address : string : nullable
        phone number : string : nullable
        website URL : string : nullable
        address : postal address : nullable
    }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>You may ask: Why not just write your <code>CREATE TABLE</code>
scripts in SQL and call that your data model?</p>

<p>SchemaSchema allows you to define common data types and use them
over and over.  If the definitions change (e.g. a user ID used to be
represented as a 32-bit integer but now it needs to be 64 bits) you
can simply change the definition and re-generate your table creation
SQL.  If you need to upgrade your database, you can use SchemaSchema
to find all columns of type 'user ID' and write the appropriate
<code>ALTER TABLE</code> statements.</p>

<p>SchemaSchemas can also declare things about your schema that aren't
limited to how it's represented in the database.  E.g. you can
indicate how certain values should be encoded in JSON or PHP.  In
First30 we have various object 'scopes', and the SchemaSchema document
indicates the scope for each table, allowing us to auto-generate data
used by the permission checking functions and service tests.</p>

<p>The result of all this auto-generation is that when we need to
change something about our schema, we can change it once in schema.txt
and let the computer do all the work that for a human to do would be
incredibly tedious and error-prone (updating the database and all
references to the changed tables).</p>

<p>The schema document also serves as a central piece of documentation
that's more easily readable than your table creation SQL.</p>
