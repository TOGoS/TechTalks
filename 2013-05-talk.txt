## Talks I wanted to give

Be Precise and Don't Repeat Yourself:
How to Talk to Computers

---
Be Explicit:
English is full of ambiguities.
Your programs should not be.

---
This is Not a Character:
The Treachery of Byte Sequences


Those talks would have been all about how to write code such that it
more clearly expresses your intentions to the computer and to other
programmers and how doing that makes your job as a programmer much
easier and helps you write programs that are more efficient and have
fewer bugs.

I would have pointed out how strongly typed languages help you do this
and how PHP and Kohana go out of their way to make it difficult.

But I don't have time for that talk, so instead I'm going to talk about
