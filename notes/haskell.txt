Approaches to doing side effects with pure functions:

- functions take the entire world as input and produce a new world
  
  Later functions depend on result of earlier functions, so earlier
  functions must be evaluated first.
  
  Downside: implies that a snapshot of the world is a value that can
  be stored and re-used, which is probably not practical.

- functions don't do side-effects themselves, but return a list
  if actions to run.

Haskell takes the latter approach.

Why is Haskell hard?
  
  The interactive interpreter can evaluate expressions but you can't
  define types with it, which might lead you to believe you're getting
  the syntax wrong when actually you just need to put it in a file and
  compile it non-interactively.  e.g.

    Prelude> type CoolAliasForInt = Int

    <interactive>:1:0: parse error on input `type'
  
  how can you do anything if functions have no side-effects?
  
    Functions don't have side-effects (except for special cases like 'debug')
    but actions can.  'IO a' is the type for an action that returns an a.  Actions that
    don't return anything are of type 'IO ()'
  
  do notation

    do
      some action
      some other action
      some third action
  
  means an action that does those 3 actions in order, and is syntactic sugar for
  
    some action >> some other action >> some third action

  (>>) is the 'action that runs the action on the left, then the one on the right' operator
  
  How can actions take parameters?
  
  They don't.  So how can you print anything?  Wouldn't the thing to be printed be a parameter?
  
  Yes, but it is a parameter to the function that returns the action, not to the action itself.
  The action is to print a specific string.  So 'putStrLn' is a function that takes a thing to
  print, and returns an action that will do the actual printing when it's run.
  
  So then how can a program make decisions at runtime if actions can't take parameters?
  
  Actions can call functions!
  
  The >>= operator takes an action with some return value and a function which accepts that
  value as an argument and returns a new action.  So
  
    getLine >>= (\line -> putStrLn line)

  is an action that runs the 'getLine' action, then takes the return value and passes it
  to putStrLn to create the next action, then runs that.
 
    do
      line <- getLine
      putStrLn line

  is syntactic sugar for the same thing.

  Types are not values
    
    -- doesn't work:
    D00D = String
    
    -- will work:
    type D00D = String
  
  What is that double arrow thing?

  It's a way to specify type constraints.
 
    SomeClass x => x
  
  means any type 'x' (the thing on the right) such that x is an
  instance of the SomeClass class.  (classes are a bit like interfaces
  in Java).

Haskell makes certain design patterns really really easy.

  e.g. the 'figure out what to do, then do it' pattern (that's how IO works in Haskell)
  
  or the state machine pattern (actions act like state machines)
